 <h2>About</h2>
 
 <p> My main interest is to model the adaptation problems organisms face, and the behavioral strategies involved in their solution. During my training, I designed a novel experimental paradigm that allows the evaluation of environments where the obtained outcomes do not depend exclusively on individual behavior, but are interdependent of the behavior of others. My research plans are aimed at identifying the critical elements (environmental structure) related to dynamic –temporal, spatial and probabilistic- constraints to account for the adaptability of behavior in different species. </p>
