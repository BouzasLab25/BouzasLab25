 <h2>About</h2>
 
<p> Hola! My name is Adriana Felisa Chávez De la Peña (just <b>Felisa</b> is fine ;) ) and I got my B.A in Psychology working at Lab25.</p>

<p>As a psychologist, I'm interested in studying the general rules that control Behavior and the Cognitive processes behind them. My main fields of interest are Bayesian Modeling (specially in terms of the study of Perceptual processes), Psychophysics, Psychometrics, Evolutionary psychology and Cognitive development. </p>

<p>Since 2015, I've been an active member of Lab25, being the one student who's interested in working with perceptual decission making. I've worked with Signal Detection Theory ever since I got in the Lab, developing a few tutorials on the subject, as well as graphical simulators (mainly on Python and RShiny) and some codes for data analysis.</p>

<p>As well as being a researcher, my passion for Experimental Psychology is reflected in a huge interest on teaching. I've worked as a T.A. for several courses given by Dr Bouzas, and I've given a few courses with two of my colleagues and best friends (José Manuel Niño and Uriel O. González Bravo, also members of Lab25). Since 2016, I've been the head student of one of the projects conducted at Lab25, where we've been developing a bunch of materials for the students of Dr' Bouzas' courses to get a better understanding of the mathematical and statistical models built within Experimental Psychology to explain a variety of behavioral phenomena, either by downloading and running them on their own computer or by exploring them online as Shiny apps.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm working at the National Institute for Educational Evaluation </p>
