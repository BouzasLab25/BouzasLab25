 <h2>About</h2>
 
<p class='text'> Hola! My name is Adriana Felisa Chávez De la Peña (just <b>Felisa</b> is fine ;) ) and I got my B.A in Psychology working at Lab25.</p>

<p class='text'>As a psychologist, I'm interested in studying the <b>general rules that control behavior and the Cognitive processes behind them</b>. My main fields of interest are Bayesian Cognitive Modeling (specially in terms of Perceptual processes), Psychophysics and Psychometrics.</p>

<p class='text'>Since 2015, I've been the one member of Lab25 who's interested in perceptual decission making. I've worked with Signal Detection Theory ever since I got in the Lab, developing a few tutorials on the subject, as well as graphical simulators (mainly on Python and RShiny) and some templates for data analysis in R.</p>

<p class='text'>Besides of conducting research, my passion for Experimental Psychology is reflected in a huge interest on teaching. I've worked as a T.A. for several courses given by Dr Bouzas, and I've given a few independent courses with my colleagues/best friends (José Manuel Niño and Uriel O. González Bravo, also members of Lab25).</p>

<p class='text'>Since 2016, I've been the head student of one of the main projects at Lab25, where we've developed a bunch of materials for students enrolled in Dr' Bouzas' courses,  so they can get a better understanding of the main mathematical and statistical models built within Experimental Psychology to explain a variety of behavioral phenomena. These materials are available for download, but can also be explored online as RShiny apps.</p>

<p class='text'>From May to December, 2018, I worked at the National Institute for Educational Evaluation doing a bunch of interesting stuff, (I learned a lot about Test development there!)</p>
