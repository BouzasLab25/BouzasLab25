### Meeting with Dr. Michael Lee and Dr. Joachim Vandekerchove, and three incredible grad students: Holy Westfall, Mac Streilof and Alex Etz.

On late March, 2019, Michael Lee returned to Lab25 along with some friends and colleagues from UC Irvine: Dr. Joachim Vandekerchove and his brilliant student Alexander Etz, Michael's own outstanding student Holy Westfall and another awesome Grad Student called Mac Strelioff.

Members of Lab25 and members of the UCI team had the chance to share their projects and research interests by running a couple sessions for informal talks and presentations. On March 27th, members of the two teams joined together at Lab25 to discuss further some ideas and start a new collaboration networking.
