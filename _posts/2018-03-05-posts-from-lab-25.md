### "Michael Lee visits Lab 25" (2018 Edition!)

Being his third visit to Lab25, Michael already knows most of the Lab25 crew. He has a a good idea of what their main interests are and, as times comes by, he has seen some of them grow and get better in the art of Bayesian Cognitive Modeling.

This year, Michael visited Lab25 to catch up with some previoulsy established collaborations, and to begin new ones!

From his very first visit! Michael has helped the members of Lab25 to get a better understanding of how Bayesian Cognitive Models can benefit Cognitive Sciences. On each visit, our projects have become more and more ambitious and Michael has always been up to help us, by showing us the best way to conduct our projects so the Bayesian modeling involved can do a better job at describing the phenomena we are interested in studying.

Michael Lee is an incredible statistician, and a beloved friend of all Lab25! We all love the motivational burst he always leaves us with!
