### Dr. Sarah Cowie visits Lab25!

From May 28 to June 7, 2019, members of the Lab25 had the chance to host a visit from Dr. Sarah Cowie, all the way from New Zealand to Mexico City!

During these two weeks, Sarah was faced with multiple presentations conducted by students of Lab25 as well as enlighting us with some of the data she has collected as part of her very own research.
