<title>Lab25 collaborations presents</title>

<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>This website was created to keep track of all the interactions that have occured between <b>Lab25</b> and <b>Dr. Michael Lee</b>, one of the biggest bayesian experts all over the world, who has somehow managed to find some space in his busy agenda to build a collaboration network which is all about Bayesian cognitive modeling! </p>

<p>It all started in 2014, when Dr. Michael Lee visited the UNAM for the very first time and students from Lab25 were just undergrads with tons of interest on bayesian modeling. (see the <b>'History'</b> menu for more info!)</p>

<p>Now, on <b>march, 2019</b> Michael's returning to Lab25 along with some of his students and colleagues to keep this academic network growing and glowing, even more!</p>
